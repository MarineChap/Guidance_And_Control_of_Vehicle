# Guidance and control of vehicles course - TTK 4190 
## (with THOR I. FOSSEN as a main teacher)

My first semester in master 2, I studied in an exchange program in the university NTNU in Norway (Trondheim). 
One of my courses was the guidance and control of vehicles. In this repository, you can find my results for the second assignment. I worked on this alone and here, we have my conclusions without correction of the teacher. <br>
 
Grade = 7/10 <br>

## Comments : 
To be honest, my English was not very good at this time and the most part of my errors and problems was related to this missing skill. On the other hand, my matlab code and my simulink code were good and should be more interesting. <br>

To run the project, we need to use a version of matlab upper to **2016a**.
